# Background

Item embedding semantic dimensionality (IESD) evaluates the dimensionality of item embeddings for questionnaire items.

## Principal components analysis (PCA)
```{r}
# ==================================================
# 8a. Embedding Dimensionality: PCA ----
# ==================================================

tfi_embeddings_texts_df <- readRDS("TFI_Embeddings_Sentences.rds")

tfi_embeddings_texts_df <- as.data.frame(tfi_embeddings_texts_df$texts)

items <- as.data.frame(t(tfi_embeddings_texts_df)) # Transpose: Dimensions → Rows, Items → Columns

# Perform PCA on transposed data
pca_result <- prcomp(items, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# Extract the eigenvalues from the PCA object
eigenvalues <- pca_result$sdev^2

# Determine y-axis limits based on max eigenvalue (rounded up)
y_max <- ceiling(max(eigenvalues))

# Create a scree plot
plot(eigenvalues,
  type = "b", pch = 19, col = "blue",
  xlab = "Principal Component",
  ylab = "Eigenvalue",
  main = "Scree Plot of PCA Eigenvalues",
  xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", # Remove default axis ticks
  ylim = c(0, y_max)
) # Set y-axis limits

# Manually add x-axis ticks for all 25 principal components
axis(1, at = 1:25, labels = 1:25, las = 2) # `las = 2` rotates labels vertically

# Manually add y-axis ticks at every whole number eigenvalue
axis(2, at = seq(0, y_max, by = 1), labels = seq(0, y_max, by = 1))

# Add a horizontal line at y = 1
abline(h = 1, col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2) # Dashed red line

## Exploratory graph analysis (EGA)

  model = "TMFG", seed = 99, type = "parametric",

) # Graphical LASSO model


# ✅ Visualize the EGA Network
plot(ega_result, title = "EGA Embeddings Dimensionality of TFI Items")

# ✅ Print Summary
summary(ega_result)


# ✅ Run Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA)
ega_result <- EGA(items, model = "glasso") # Graphical LASSO model

bootstrapped_ega <- bootEGA(items,
  model = "TMFG", iter = 500, seed = 99, type = "parametric",
  algorithm = "leiden", na.data = "pairwise", uni.method = "louvain"
